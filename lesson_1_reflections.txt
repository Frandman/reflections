How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
With diff command i'm able to see those lines added to and deleted from files, so i can realize where the bug was introduced.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
